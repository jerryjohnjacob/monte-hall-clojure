# Monte Hall Problem Solution in Clojure

A basic solution illustrating the solution to the probability problem that is the Monty Hall Problem:

Suppose you're on a game show, and you're given the choice of three doors: Behind one door is a car; behind the others, goats. You pick a door, say No. 1, and the host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens another door, say No. 3, which has a goat. He then says to you, "Do you want to pick door No. 2?" Is it to your advantage to switch your choice?

The Monty Hall Problem talks of 3 choices. This solution will help illustrate the drastic change in the possibility of making the right choice after switching as the number of choices increases.
